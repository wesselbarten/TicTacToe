# Tic-Tac-Toe Kata

The initial SW Craftsmanship Dojo® assessment consists of developing a Tic-Tac-Toe game
adhering to the three rules of Test-Driven Development.

## Kata Objective:
The Tic-Tac-Toe game runs in BOT mode. The rules of the game are here:

## Customer’s desires:
The system should run in BOT mode (random BOT moves for players X & O), printing on the
screen all the player’s moves (with a 2-second timeout between each round) until someone wins
or the game ends with a draw.

## Scoring system – Create the TicTacToe Game:
🎯 Target: deliver the TicTacToe game, version BOT vs. BOT running in a shell.
1. CodeBase: must be in public GitHub/GitLab/etc.
2. First push: an empty directory or the cookie-cutter’s template
3. Time Box: 2 hours (4 🍅) to code and refactor
4. Solo mode: no pair, no mob programming
5. Helper: no copy & paste allowed, nor use of ChatGTP/Kite/Sorcery/CodeWhisperer/etc.
6. Backlog: a BACKLOG.md file with the US you designed
7. Notes: a NOTES.md file with your pomodoro flow
8. Three laws of TDD: within 🔴/🟢/♻ cycles
9. Git History: commit any 🔴/🟢/♻ cycle to have a readable history in Git
10. Coverage: 100% all the time
11. Simple design: keep it ‘stupid-simple’
12. Emerging Architecture: code behaviors are emerging commit after commit
13. Refactoring pillars:
    a. Test report as a book (DDD vocabulary)
    b. Code and test wording with a DDD vocabulary
    c. Code with ‘Extract until you can’t’ clean code principle
14. Demo time: provide the script to run the demo and DIVIO docs (how-to)
